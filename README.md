# About the Project

The alxtravelapp project is a real-world Django application that serves as the foundation for a travel listing platform. This milestone focuses on setting up the initial project structure, configuring a robust database, and integrating tools to ensure API documentation and maintainable configurations. The aim is to equip learners with industry-standard best practices for starting and managing Django-based projects efficiently.

This milestone will teach you to set up a scalable backend, integrate MySQL for database management, and use Swagger for automated API documentation. These foundational steps are critical in preparing the application for future features and seamless team collaboration.
